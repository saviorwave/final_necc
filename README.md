NECC Python Final Project

This program is a basic expense and financing tracker. It uses expense inputs from a user to categorize expenses based on categories and timeframe(month). The program asks for the user to get a filepath, then asks to input new data or retrieve historical data and stats. If the user picks to add new data, it will ask for the category and the amount. The program uses that and the current month to organize this new data where it fits. If the user wants to retrieve data, the progam ask if they want the full historical data or partial user selected data. Full returns all data for the user and stats. User selected allows the user to select month(s) and category(s) to print back.
